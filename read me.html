<p align="left"><b>About DX Snakes</b></p>
<p align="left">DX snakes is my third game in my DX series. Like the last two,
it was made in just one day! 3 days on the trot now! I'm chucking out games
pretty fast now I've just got DirectX 7. I'll settle down and make a bigger game
soon. Anywayz,&nbsp; DX Snakes is a game where you have to steer a snake and eat
apples. Simple, but fun.</p>
<p align="left"><b>PC requirements</b></p>
<p align="left">You must have DirectX version 7 or higher installed. A bog
standard 640x480 compatible 16 bit or more color monitor will do as well. A fast
PC will make faster graphics. My 400Mhz does 91 frames per second!!! And I know
people with PC's way faster than mine. If you have a slow PC, even a 133Mhz, the
game should be able to keep above the adequate 30 FPS (the rate human sight
works at or summit). If you're interested, the game prints the FPS to the debug
window.</p>
<p align="left"><b>How to Play</b></p>
<p align="left">Just click on the file 'DXsnakes.exe' to play. Use the arrow
keys to control the snake. At the title screen, press a number from 1-9 to
select the difficulty level. I recommend that you choose 3 to start with. Press
Escape to quit before game over. Game over happens when you crash your snake. If
you like, you can <a href="DXsnakes.exe">Click Here</a> to start the game right
now!</p>
